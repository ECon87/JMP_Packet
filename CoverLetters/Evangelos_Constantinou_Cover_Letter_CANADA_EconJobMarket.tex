% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor of Economics as advertised on EconJobMarket.
I am a microeconomist specializing in political economy and industrial organization with particular focus on political communication, timing of elections and firm pricing.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

% I am extremely interested in joining the faculty of <UNIVERSITY APPLY>.
As a member of the faculty, I will contribute to its focus on economics education,
continue my research on strategic communication and firm pricing, and lead departmental service activities.
%
% I find <UNIVERSITY APPLY>'stradition for teaching and its research philosophy very stimulating.
I am confident that my enthusiasm for teaching, my theoretical and empirical approach to studying socially relevant topics, 
and my track record for collaborative work make me an excellent fit for the position in your department. 

% I find <UNIVERSITY APPLY>'s research approach to studying <ISSUES to study> very exciting and stimulating.

% I find the research philosophy at <UNIVERSITY APPLY> very stimulating, and 
% I am confident that my theoretical and empirical approach to studying socially relevant topics, 
% my motivation to actively engage in innovative research,
% and my track record for collaborative work make me an excellent fit for the position in your department. 

%%% START: Own Research %%%
My research examines issues in political economy and industrial organization.
In my job market paper, I theoretically and empirically analyze how politicians strategically vary ad content and placement to mobilize their base and demobilize the opposing one.
In industrial organization, I theoretically investigate topics such as price-matching guarantees, co-location, and secondary markets.
Currently, in a joint work, my co-author and I empirically measure the switching costs that emerge from airline entry in new US domestic airports.
% To achieve this, we use both reduced form and structural methods.
% Consistent with the theory, I find that opposing US gubernatorial and presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012  target different (and more polarized) audiences with policy ads.
% Positive valence ads --- emphasizing own positive non-policy attributes --- are mostly targeted to a candidateâ€™s alienated base, while negative valence ads are targeted to the opponent's base in a effort to depress their turnout.
%%% END: Own research %%%

%%% START: Industry %%%
% In my research, I make extensive use of the latest empirical methods and statistical tools.
% In my job market paper on strategic communication by politicians, I employ both machine learning (supervised learning) and natural language techniques to classify political ads into distinct classes based on their content.
% I then use tools from causal inference such as instrumental variable estimation to test the theoretical predictions of my model.
% In an ongoing work, my co-author and I use both reduced form and structural methods to estimate the switching costs that emerge from airline entry in new airports.

% During my doctoral studies, I have become proficient in both the Python and R scripting languages, which I use both for research and teaching.
% I use the former for tasks related to machine and deep learning, natural language processing and web-scrapping.
% I use the latter for statistical and econometric analyses.

% I find work being done at <UNIVERSITY APPLY> very exciting and stimulating.
% I am confident that the skill set I developed during my graduate studies, and my strong track record for collaborative work make me an excellent fit for the position <POSITION>.
%%% END: Industry %%%


%%% START: Teaching %%%
% In addition, I have a strong interest in teaching.
% As I mention in my teaching statement, I have extensive teaching experience in a range of topics.
% During my doctoral studies at Illinois, I was honored to be selected by my students among the top 10\% of teachers in the university.
