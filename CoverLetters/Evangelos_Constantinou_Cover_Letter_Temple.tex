\begin{letter}{Department of Political Science,\\
Temple University}

% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor in American Politics, as advertised on Interfolio.
I am a doctoral candidate specializing in political economy with particular focus on American politics, political communication, and the timing of elections.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

I am extremely interested in joining the faculty of Political Science at Temple University.
As a member of the department, I will contribute to its focus on political science education,
continue my research on political advertising and sequential elections, and lead departmental service activities.

I find the research agenda at Temple very stimulating.
In particular, my work can complement the exciting research by
Professor Hagen on political advertising and the effects of campaigns,
the work on campaign finance by Professor Kolodny,
Professor Guisinger's work on government communication, and Professor Ziegfeld's work on electoral politics and voter turnout.
I am confident that my theoretical and empirical approach to studying socially relevant topics, my motivation to actively engage in innovative research, and my track record for collaborative work make me an excellent fit for the position in your department. 

% professor Arduini's approach to heterogeneous treatment effects, the network analysis of time series of professor Barigozzi, and professor Cavaliere's research on bootstrap-based inference.

In addition, I have a strong interest in teaching.
As I mention in my teaching statement, I have extensive teaching experience in a range of topics.
During my doctoral studies at Illinois, I was honored to be selected by my students among the top 10\% of teachers in the university.


Included in my application are copies of my CV, my job market paper titled ``Messaging the Bases: Tailoring of Political Ads to Audiences'',
statements on my research agenda and teaching philosophy, and a statement affirming my commitment to diversity and inclusion.
My other work is outlined in my research statement and I would be happy to make any additional materials available to you upon request.
Letters in support of my application from Professors Dan Bernhardt (Chair), George Deltas, and Stefan Krasa will be sent under a separate cover. 

% Let me emphasize that, unlike most students at {\small US} schools, I am particularly interested in positions in Europe as this will facilitate matching with my partner, so the timing of this job opening is ideal.

% I will be available for virtual interviews at the <AMERICAN OR EUROPEAN JOB MARKET IN DECEMBER 2021>.
I can be reached via email at ecnstnt2@illinois.edu or by phone at +1-217-721-5834.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any additional information that I can provide.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
my significant teaching experience make me an excellent fit for the position in your department. 
% In attesa di un Vostro gentile riscontro, ringrazio per l'attenzione e porgo distinti saluti.\\
