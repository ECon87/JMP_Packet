\begin{letter}{The Coleridge Initiative.}

% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Senior Research Scientist as advertised on AEA JOE.
I am a microeconomist specializing in political economy and industrial organization with particular focus on political communication and firm pricing.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

I am extremely interested in joining the Coleridge Initiative.
During my research and studies I have gained and honed skills that make me an excellent fit for the Economist position, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item expertise in econometric modeling and statistical analysis,
    \item proficiency in advanced statistical software such as R, Python, and Stata,
    \item extensive experience working with big data sets (cleaning, merging and analyzing),
    \item effective communication demonstrated by drafting and presenting reports of academic research for a wide variety of audiences and publishing in leading economic journals,
    \item proven track record in collaborative and independent work,
\end{itemize}

In addition, my experience as a Teaching Fellow at the University of Cyprus and Head Teaching Assistant at the University of Illinois demonstrate my professional progress and capabilities.
My years as an instructor have sharpened my verbal and written communication skills to effectively communicate with a broad range of audiences.

I will bring these assets and more to the Coleridge Initiative.
%%% START: Included %%%
% Included in my application are copies of my CV, my job market paper titled ``Messaging the Bases: Tailoring Political Ads to Audiences'', statements on my research agenda and teaching philosophy, and a statement affirming my commitment to diversity and inclusion.
% My other work is outlined in my research statement and I would be happy to make any additional materials available to you upon request.
Letters in support of my application from Professors Dan Bernhardt (Chair), George Deltas, and Stefan Krasa can be requested from the proxy person in our department Tera Martin-Roy at econ-phdjobs@illinois.edu (or tnmartin@illinois.edu).

% I will be available for virtual interviews at the <AMERICAN OR EUROPEAN JOB MARKET IN DECEMBER 2021>.
I can be reached via email at ecnstnt2@illinois.edu or by phone at +1-217-721-5834.
