\begin{letter}{Department of Politics,\\
Princeton University.}

% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Postdoctoral Research Associate in Formal Theory \& Quantitative Methods as advertised on APSA.
I am a doctoral candidate specializing in political economy with particular focus on American politics and formal theory.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

I am extremely interested in joining the Department of Politics at Princeton.
As a member of the department, I will contribute to its focus on political science education,
continue my research on strategic political communication, and lead departmental service activities.

% I find Princeton's tradition for teaching and its research philosophy very stimulating.
% I am confident that my enthusiasm for teaching, my theoretical and empirical approach to studying socially relevant topics, 
% I am confident that my theoretical and empirical approach to studying socially relevant topics,
% and my track record for collaborative work make me an excellent fit for the position in your department.

I find the research agenda at the Department of Politics at Princeton very stimulating.
I believe that my combination of theoretical and empirical skills make me a valuable collaborator for the Formal Theory \& Quantitative Methods research groups.
My current research examines issues related to strategic communication and timing of elections.
Specifically, in my job market paper I theoretically and empirically analyze how politicians strategically vary ad content and placement to mobilize their base and demobilize the opposing one.
% Consistent with the theory, I find that opposing US gubernatorial and presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012  target different (and more polarized) audiences with policy ads.
% Positive valence ads --- emphasizing own positive non-policy attributes --- are mostly targeted to a candidateâ€™s alienated base, while negative valence ads are targeted to the opponent's base in a effort to depress their turnout.
In other work, I examine whether candidates of the same party, who advertise in the same district, free ride off of each others ads.
In joint work, my co-author and I characterize conditions such that voting outcomes are independent of voting order.
% In industrial organization, I theoretically investigate topics such as price-matching guarantees, co-location, and secondary markets.
% Currently, in a joint work, my co-author and I empirically measure the switching costs that emerge from airline entry in new US domestic airports.
% To achieve this, we use both reduced form and structural methods.

I must emphasize that I truly enjoy collaborative work as my track record of co-authored work demonstrates.
I would be excited to work on campaign financing with Professor Canes-Wrone, on misinformation and digital media with Professor Guess, lobbying with Professor Judd, and political extremism with Professor Li.
