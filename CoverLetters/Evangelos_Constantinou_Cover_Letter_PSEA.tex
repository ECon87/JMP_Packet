% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Director of Research for Surveys as advertised on AEA's Joe board.
I am a doctoral candidate in Economics specializing in political economy and industrial organization with particular focus on political communication, and the timing of elections.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

I am extremely interested in joining PSEA.
During my research and studies I have gained and honed skills that make me an excellent fit for the position of Assistant Director of Research for Surveys, including:

\begin{itemize}
    \item expertise in advanced statistical and econometric analysis,
    \item proficiency in advanced statistical software such as STATA and R,
    \item extensive experience analyzing political and public opinion surveys,
    \item effective communication demonstrated by drafting and presenting reports of academic research for a wide variety of audiences,
    \item proven track record in collaborative work.
\end{itemize}

I will bring these assets and more to PSEA.
My research interests and projects throughout my doctoral studies have centered on studying political campaigns, political polls and analyzing data to evaluate through the use of the latest empirical methods the impact of different interventions.

In addition, my experience as a Teaching Fellow at the University of Cyprus and Head Teaching Assistant at the University of Illinois demonstrate my professional progress and capabilities.
My years as an instructor have sharpened my verbal and written communication skills to effectively communicate with a broad range of audiences.


I can be reached via email at ecnstnt2@illinois.edu or by phone at +1-217-721-5834.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any additional information that I can provide.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
