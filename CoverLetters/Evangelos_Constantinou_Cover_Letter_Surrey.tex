\begin{letter}{Department of Economics,\\
University of Surrey.}

% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor of Economics beginning September 2022, as advertised on Econ Job Market.
I am a microeconomist specializing in political economy and industrial organization with particular focus on political communication, timing of elections and firm pricing.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

I am extremely interested in joining the faculty of Surrey.
As a member of the department, I will contribute to its focus on economics education,
continue my research on strategic communication and firm pricing, and lead departmental service activities.

I find the research philosophy at Surrey very stimulating.
I believe that my work can complement the exciting work on political economy and
voting by Professors Bozbay, Gershkov and Zanardi.
I am confident that my theoretical and empirical approach to studying socially relevant topics, 
% my motivation to actively engage in innovative research,
and my track record for collaborative work make me an excellent fit for the position in your department. 

%%% START: Own Research %%%
My research examines issues in political economy and industrial organization.
In my job market paper, I theoretically and empirically characterize how politicians strategically vary ad content and placement to mobilize their base and demobilize the opposing one.
% Consistent with the theory, I find that opposing US gubernatorial and presidential candidates in 2008 and 2012  target different (and more polarized) audiences with policy ads.
% Positive valence ads --- emphasizing own positive non-policy attributes --- are mostly targeted to a candidateâ€™s alienated base, while negative valence ads are targeted to the opponent's base in a effort to depress their turnout.
In industrial organization, my theoretical work examines topics such as price-matching guarantees, co-location, and secondary markets.
Currently, in a joint work, my co-author and I empirically measure the switching costs that emerge from airline entry in new US domestic airports.
% To achieve this, we use both reduced form and structural methods.
%%% END: Own research %%%

%%% START: Teaching %%%
In addition, I have a strong interest in teaching, and I have experience teaching a wide range of topics.
During my doctoral studies at Illinois, I was honored to be selected by my students among the top 10\% of teachers in the university.
%%% END: Teaching %%%

Included in my application are my CV, my job market paper titled
``Messaging the Bases: Tailoring Political Ads to Audiences'',
a second joint paper on firm co-location,
and statements summarizing my research agenda and teaching philosophy.
% I would be happy to make any additional materials available to you upon request.
Letters in support of my application from Professors Dan Bernhardt (Chair), George Deltas, and Stefan Krasa will be sent under a separate cover. 

% Let me emphasize that, unlike most students at {\small US} schools, I am particularly interested in positions in Europe as this will facilitate matching with my partner, so the timing of this job opening is ideal.

I will be available for virtual interviews at the European Job Market in
December 2021 or earlier.
I can be reached via email at ecnstnt2@illinois.edu or by phone at +1-217-721-5834.
Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any additional information that I can provide.


Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
% In attesa di un Vostro gentile riscontro, ringrazio per l'attenzione e porgo distinti saluti.\\
