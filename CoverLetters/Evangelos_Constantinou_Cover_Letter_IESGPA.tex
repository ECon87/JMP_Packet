% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor (tenure-track) beginning September 1, 2022, as advertised on Interfolio.
I am a doctoral candidate specializing in political economy organization with particular focus on political communication and timing of elections.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

I am extremely interested in joining the faculty of IEGPA.
As a member of the department, I will contribute to its focus on interdisciplinary education,
continue my research on strategic communication and elections, and lead departmental service activities.

I find IEGPA's research approach to studying global issues at the intersection of politics and economics very exciting and stimulating.
I am confident that my theoretical and empirical approach to studying socially relevant topics, 
my motivation to actively engage in innovative research, and my track record for collaborative work
make me an excellent fit for the position in your department. 

%I find the econometric approach to studying inequality measures done at the Ecole d'Economie d'Aix Marseille very stimulating.

In addition, I have a strong interest in teaching, and I have extensive teaching experience in a range of topics.
During my doctoral studies at Illinois, I was honored to be selected by my students among the top 10\% of teachers in the university.


Included in my application are copies of my CV and my job market paper titled ``Messaging the Bases: Tailoring of Political Ads to Audiences''.
I would be happy to share additional materials regarding my other work upon your request.
Letters in support of my application from Professors Dan Bernhardt (Chair), George Deltas, and Stefan Krasa will be sent under a separate cover. 

% Let me emphasize that, unlike most students at {\small US} schools, I am particularly interested in positions in Europe as this will facilitate matching with my partner, so the timing of this job opening is ideal.

% I will be available for virtual interviews at the European Job Market in December 2021.
I can be reached via email at ecnstnt2@illinois.edu or by phone at +1-217-721-5834.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any additional information that I can provide.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
% In attesa di un Vostro gentile riscontro, ringrazio per l'attenzione e porgo distinti saluti.\\
