  Dear Members of the Search Committee,

  My name is Evangelos Constantinou, and I am a job market candidate from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
  I recently applied for the position of Assistant Professor in your department.
  However, I mistakenly recorded an old cell-phone number in my CV.

  My current number is 217-721-5834.

  Thank you for your time and consideration.

  Kind Regards,
  Evangelos Constantinou.
