\begin{letter}{Department of <DEPARTMENT APPLY>\\
<UNIVERSITY APPLY>}

% \opening{Dear Members of the Recruiting Committee,}
\opening{Dear Members of the Search Committee,}

I am writing to apply for the position of Assistant Professor in <POSITION> beginning <START DATE>, as advertised on <JOB BOARD>.
I am a microeconomist specializing in political economy and industrial organization with particular focus on American politics, political communication, timing of elections and firm pricing.
I will complete my Ph.D. in Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in May 2022. 

I am extremely interested in joining the faculty of <UNIVERSITY APPLY>.
As a member of the department, I will contribute to its focus on <EDUCATION FOCUS> education,
continue my research on < CONTINUE RESEARCH FOCUS>, and lead departmental service activities.

I find <UNIVERSITY APPLY>'s research approach to studying <ISSUES to study> very exciting and stimulating.
I am confident that my theoretical and empirical approach to socially relevant topics, 
my motivation to actively engage in innovative research, and my track record for collaborative work
make me an excellent fit for the position in your department. 

%I find the econometric approach to studying inequality measures done at the Ecole d'Economie d'Aix Marseille very stimulating.

In addition, I have a strong interest in teaching.
As I mention in my teaching statement, I have extensive teaching experience in a range of topics.
During my doctoral studies at Illinois, I was honored to be selected by my students among the top 10\% of teachers in the university.


Included in my application are copies of my CV, my job market paper titled ``Messaging the Bases: Tailoring Political Ads to Audiences'',
statements on my research agenda and teaching philosophy, and a statement affirming my commitment to diversity and inclusion.
My other work is outlined in my research statement and I would be happy to make any additional materials available to you upon request.
Letters in support of my application from Professors Dan Bernhardt (Chair), George Deltas, and Stefan Krasa will be sent under a separate cover. 

% Let me emphasize that, unlike most students at {\small US} schools, I am particularly interested in positions in Europe as this will facilitate matching with my partner, so the timing of this job opening is ideal.

I will be available for virtual interviews at the <AMERICAN OR EUROPEAN JOB MARKET IN DECEMBER 2021>.
I can be reached via email at ecnstnt2@illinois.edu or by phone at +1-217-721-5834.

Please do not hesitate to contact me if there is any additional information that I can provide.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
% In attesa di un Vostro gentile riscontro, ringrazio per l'attenzione e porgo distinti saluti.\\
