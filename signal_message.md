Dear Members of the Search Committee,

I am writing to express my deep interest in the position of Assistant Professor of Economics at Missouri. As you can see from my application package, I have a broad research agenda, which addresses what I believe to be economically and socially relevant topics in political economy and industrial organization.  I am confident that my dexterity in both applied theory and empirical methodology complements and adds value to the strong research group at Missouri.

Furthermore, I very much enjoy collaborative work as my record of co-authored work demonstrates. As a result, I am very excited at the prospect of working with Professor Loginova and Professor Milyo to produce high quality research papers in industrial organization and political economy, respectively. I should also mention that I am adept at working with colleagues from other fields. I enjoy sharing insights from the different fields to produce research that lies in the intersection of them. For example, I currently collaborate with two of my classmates (Anna Kyriazis and Felipe Diaz) on a project that speaks both to the crime and political economy literature.

In addition, I truly enjoy teaching, and the University of Missouri offers an ideal teaching environment. The student population at Missouri is exceptional, and I am confident that teaching at Missouri will be an enriching experience.

Finally, Columbia is a beautiful city and the Midwest is a magnificent area to raise my son. Moreover, my wife's family is from Urbana, Illinois, and it would be a privilege to be geographically close to it.

The University of Missouri offers everything I wish in a placement: a world-class institution with a tradition for outstanding research and teaching, and ideally geographically located.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Kind Regards,
Evangelos Consantinou.
